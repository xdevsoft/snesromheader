# Reading SNES ROM Header
How to read SNES ROM file using Python struct module

Follow-up tutorials for Python "struct" module, this time we will open and read a binary file and parse the content.
I will also improved and extend this simple example and you will also see how it will be used.

That's why I want to share my experience and adventure while I'm building it.
